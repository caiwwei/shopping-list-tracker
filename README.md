# Shopping List Tracker

## General Information

This **Shopping List Tracker** will be able to log prices, discount codes, links to online shopping sites, and other
additional information for products, in order to make tracking what you need to buy easier and more intuitive. This
application can be used by anyone, and will be a great way to ensure that you remember what you need to buy, while also
tracking expenses and finding the best discounts. I personally chose to work on this project due to my own need for an
easy-to-use shopping list application that also had a lot of useful functions, and I hope that this will be beneficial
to both me and others who use this.
